# XML-Schema-Generator

#### DESCRIPTION

An MFC App that allows you to create a schema of simple as well as complex elements. Starting with the <schema> element, you can add any number of your custom elements with easy-to-use GUI. For complex elements with the type “none”, you can recursively add any number of child elements and attributes. Once you are done adding elements, the generate button on the main dialog recursively build schema string that can be imported that can be saved as an .XSD file.
